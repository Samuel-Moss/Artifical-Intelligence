# I need to answer a question
# How well can a students grade be predicted based on factors such as Hours Studied, Attendance, Gender, Parental Involvement, etc?


# Hypothosis:

# The following factors will have much less of an impact:
# - Gender: Does not put any restraints on being able to study
# - Family Income: Whilst this may associate with other factors, family income alone does not neccessarily mean access to resources in insufficent. Especially with schemes and measures in place

# The following factors will have much more of an impact:
# - Study Hours
# - Motivation
# - Internet Access (remember that this can be used negatively just as well as positively! - i.e. online games)
