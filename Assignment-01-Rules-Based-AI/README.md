# Artificial Intelligence

## Dataset
- **Link:** [Student Performance Factors Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors)
> **Note:** This dataset does not include a specific age group.

## Objective
To predict final grades based on factors such as:
- Hours Studied
- Attendance
- Parental Involvement
- Access to Resources
- Extracurricular Activities
- Sleep Hours
- Previous Scores
- Motivation Level
- Internet Access
- Tutoring Sessions
- Family Income
- Teacher Quality
- School Type
- Peer Influence
- Physical Activity
- Learning Disabilities
- Distance from Home
- Gender
- Exam Score
This could help schools identify students who are at risk of getting lower scores, allowing them to focus on those who are much more higher risk


### Hypothesis
- **Lower Impact Factors:** Gender, Family Income
- **Higher Impact Factors:** Study Hours, Motivation, Internet Access (could be a double-edged sword)

## AI Model Approach
- **Model 1:** BFS / DFS (Undecided)
- **Model 2:** BFS/DFS/Algorithm X (Undecided)
